At Reloadly ,we believe in a set of practices, ethics, and behaviors that all employees  
must adhere to. These Standards of conduct is a set of norms that we expect from our  
employees to embrace behavior and culture. A professional code of conduct outlines  
appropriate actions for employees or members, as well as the legal consequences of  
breaking these rules. 



To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work  
environment, Reloadly expects employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the  
interests and safety of all Team Members and the organization. The purpose of these  
rules is not to restrict your rights, but rather to be certain that you understand what  
conduct is expected and necessary. 



Before detailing or expanding on specific  
behaviours which will lead to disciplinary action, let’s refresh and talk about our values  
and we expect you to demonstrate.

&nbsp;

**How to demonstrate these values and ethical behaviours**
----------------------------------------------------------

*   Punctuality: If we have a meeting we have to organise ourselves in order to  
    attend it on time.
    
*   Working hours: If you are a full time employee, your working hours will be at least  
    8, from Monday to Friday. If you are a part time employee it will be 4 hours  
    instead.
    
*   Work schedule: We are flexible about everyone’s schedule while accomplishing  
    with your daily working hours and adapt it to your meetings, calls, duties, etc.
    
*   Availability: It is compulsory to be available and reachable by your fellow  
    employees and customers during your daily working hours.
    
*   Meetings: We have to attend all the regular (or single) meetings in order to be  
    updated and discuss any issue.
    
*   Training: Reloadly will offer and display training, new documentation updates,  
    follow-up meetings according to the needs detected and so employees have to  
    undertake them.
    
*   Communication: We like and need to keep fluent communication. Slack is our  
    basic and quickest way of communication so we have to set it up according to  
    our appointments (so we don’t get interrupted) and be available during our  
    working hours. We also need to communicate clearly to our teammates, and  
    unblock communication barriers.
    
*   Video on: Nonverbal communication plays a significant role when  
    communicating, it helps us to relate, engage, and establish meaningful  
    interactions and deeper relationships. Most experts agree that 70 to 93 percent  
    of all communication is nonverbal, we have to take advantage of it! During our  
    video calls with customers we have to turn our video on to get the most of it.  
    When meeting with colleagues it is needed to do it too (depends on every team’  
    agreement).

## RELOADLY'S CODE OF CONDUCT

  
&nbsp;

**COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS**

Acting ethically and obeying the law, both in letter and spirit, are among Reloadly’s core values. We expect employees and consultants to understand the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to their area of responsibility, including federal, state, and foreign laws, as well as the relevant regulatory schemes. All employees are also expected to act with integrity and to exercise good judgment and common sense in their efforts to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and are encouraged to ask the People Department for advice when they are uncertain about them.

  

We also believe that every employee is responsible for becoming familiar with Reloadly’s policies so that they may integrate them into every aspect of our business. 

  

Reloadly considers violation of the law, company/firm policies, and this Code of Conduct to be a serious matter. Any violation may subject an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Additionally, those who work with us, including founders, contractors, consultants, volunteers, and their representatives (collectively, “third parties”), are expected to maintain professional conduct and follow all applicable laws and regulations. 

  

Certain violations may be referred to legal authorities for investigation and civil or criminal prosecution. If you become aware of the violation of any law by Reloadly, whether by its officers, employees, or any third party doing business on behalf of Reloadly, it is your responsibility to promptly report the matter to your CEO. 

While Reloadly strives to address matters internally, nothing in this Code of Conduct should discourage you from reporting illegal activity, including any violation of the law whether federal, state, local, or foreign law, rule or regulation, to the appropriate regulatory authority. This Code of Conduct should not be construed to prohibit employees from testifying, participating, or otherwise assisting in any state or federal administrative, judicial or legislative proceeding or investigation.

&nbsp;

**ADDRESSING CONDUCT THAT IS HARMFUL TO OUR CULTURE AND VALUES**

Reloadly respects the rights of all employees to express themselves. We believe that open dialogue and free expression of ideas is critical to our business. However, Reloadly will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to address situations where an employee’s conduct or speech endangers the safety of others, violates others’ rights to be free from harassment, discrimination, and retaliation, or otherwise conflicts with Reloadly’s culture and values, up to and including termination of employment.

&nbsp;

**HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT AND FAIR DEALING**

Reloadly employees should endeavor to act honestly, ethically, and fairly in both internal and external dealings, including interactions with co-workers, limited partners, portfolio companies, service providers, and any other third parties with which Reloadly may conduct business. Statements regarding Reloadly’s business must not be untrue, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent. You must not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair dealing practice. Employees are also prohibited from creating or submitting false, inaccurate, or misleading invoices, receipts, or other financial or business-related documents to Reloadly or related businesses.

&nbsp;

**UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR**   

The rules set forth below are intended to provide employees with notice of what is expected of them. However, such rules cannot possibly identify every type of unacceptable conduct and performance. Therefore, employees should be aware that conduct not specifically listed below but which adversely affects or is otherwise detrimental to the interests of the Reloadly, other employees, or customers, may also result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.

  

Employees may be disciplined for misconduct, including but not limited to the following:

*   Insubordination
    
*   Dishonesty
    
*   Theft
    
*   Misusing or destroying Reloadly property or the property of another on Reloadly  premises
    
*   Violating conflict of interest rules
    
*   Disclosing or using confidential or proprietary information without authorization
    
*   Falsifying or altering Reloadly records, including an application for employment or time records
    
*   Interfering with the work performance of others
    
*   Altercations
    
*   Harassment, including sexually harassing employees, customers, and third parties
    
*   Being under the influence of, manufacturing, dispensing, distributing, using, or possessing alcohol or illegal or controlled substances on Reloadly property or while conducting Reloadly business
    
*   Sleeping on the job or leaving your work location/work site without authorization 
    
*   Violation of safety or health rules
    
*   Possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon or materials on Reloadly property or while conducting Reloadly business
    
*   Being convicted of a crime that indicates unfitness for the job or raises a threat to the safety or well-being of the Company, its employees, customers, or property
    
*   Gambling on Reloadly premises or while conducting Reloadly business
    
*   Failure to call in or report for your scheduled shift of work. An absence of three (3) consecutive scheduled workdays without notifying your supervisor or his or her designee is job abandonment and is considered a voluntary resignation.
    

  

Reloadly reserves the right to proceed directly to a written warning, demotion, or termination for misconduct or performance deficiency, without resort to prior disciplinary steps, when the Reloadly deems such action appropriate.
