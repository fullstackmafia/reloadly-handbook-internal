**CAC**

  

**Customer Acquisition Cost**

  

This metric allows us to understand how much investment it takes to acquire new clients.

  

This metric will be divided in separate acquisition channels as the CR from each one varies. The recommendations about investment will arise from these numbers. 

  

We will have these numbers coming from Pipedrive (CRM) so we need to follow up with the Sales Team in order to get everything updated before we start.
