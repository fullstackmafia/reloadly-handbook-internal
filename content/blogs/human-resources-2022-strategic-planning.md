## Surveys implemented
    

  

*   Onboarding feedback: 1st week + every month up to 3 months
    
*   Wellbeing & Culture: Feedback meeting after the survey is completed to deep into what is needed
    

&nbsp;

   **ONBOARDING**
    

  

*   New employees onboarding experience: 
    

  

From what Reloadly has been doing until I joined the company, I did some changes in order to have everything totally set up before the person starts with us. 

*   The training sessions are recorded as videos so people can watch them as many times as they need and practice on their own. Then, there are meetings as well so they can solve any doubts and deep in their knowledge. 
    
*   They are enrolled in the insurance from day one.
    
*   One week in advance or two: They get the contract to sign it. This gives them trust and confidence so they feel we are working on their journey with us and so they can quit their current job without hesitations. 
    
*   They also get the background check and the NDA and Non Compete agreements to sign before joining us.
    
*   The week before the start date, they receive an email with their Reloadly’s email account details so they can set it up. They also get the agenda for their first week: the bootcamp. Everything is scheduled: buddy pairing, meetings, lectures, trainings and the documentation they need to read. 
    
*   One week after they have a follow up with me to assess expectations, motivation, workload, missing trainings or tools, improvements, etc.
    
*   One month after joining (and up to 3 months) they get the Onboarding survey via Factorial to assess deeply how they are doing and feeling, missing and willing and so we can redress anything. We have a meeting to talk about everything, along with their managers.
    
&nbsp;

   **HIRING**
    

  

Improving and expanding the sources for finding talent. Coordinating with every department’s manager to get the maximum information to find the right candidate.

I do proactive search on Linkedin to find the right candidates. I reach out to them and manage to schedule interviews.

Starting with Sales Navigator and waiting for the Linkedin Recruiter tool to be active.

&nbsp;

   **PERFORMANCE**
    

  

I am working on a performance assessment survey. It’s going to include soft skills and hard skills. 

  
&nbsp;
   HARD SKILLS:
    

  

Abilities that let you tackle job-specific duties and responsibilities. Hard skills can be learned through courses, vocational training, and on the job. These skills are usually focused on specific tasks and processes such as the use of tools, equipment, or software.

  
&nbsp;
   SOFT SKILLS: 
    

  

Interpersonal and behavioral skills that help you work well with other people and develop your career. are abilities that relate to how you work and how you interact with other people.
