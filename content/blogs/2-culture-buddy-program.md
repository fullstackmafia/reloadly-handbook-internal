Who is a buddy? A buddy is someone who partners with a new employee during his/her firsts days of employment. 

The purpose of new employees being assigned a buddy is to help welcome employees and **reaffirm their decision** to join Reloadly. It provides new employees with a reliable, motivated, single **point-of-contact for their basic questions** regarding their work experience at the company. It also helps establish orientation as a process, rather than a single learning event. 

&nbsp;

*   **Objective**:  
    
*   Give advice and guidance regarding the day-to-day aspects
    
*   Offer encouragement and knowledge resources, as they help introduce the new employee to the Reloadly culture. 
    
*   Build up a relationship
    
*   Be supportive and human
    

*   **Why have a buddy?**
    

*   Reduce the initial confusion and uncertainty faced by all new employees
    
*   Build up a relationship
    
*   Enable new employees to become knowledgeable about department practices and organizational culture in a shorter period 
    
*   Ensure that routine queries regarding basic operational issues are dealt with expeditiously
    
*   Increase the new employee’s self-confidence allowing him/her to focus on adding value to the organization 
    

&nbsp;

What the Buddy Expects From their New Employee:  

*   The new employee will receive constructive criticism in good spirit
    
*   The new employee will display a “coachable” attitude 
    
*   The new employee will display an eagerness to learn
