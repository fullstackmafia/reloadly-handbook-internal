Growth Functions
====================================


This section describes the core functions of the growth team.

&nbsp;

Key Functions
-------------

We develop and execute marketing strategies to support the business growth in each stage of the funnel:

*   Acquisition  
    
    *   Conversion
        
    *   Retention  
        

The most important differentiator from a Marketing approach is that Growth builds a strategy that combines activities in the three stages of the funnel.

**TOFU (Top of the funnel)**: Analyze and optimize acquisition channels to increase qualified traffic to our website/ platform and work to optimize segmentation. Main KPI: Number of Qualified Leads.

**MOFU (Middle of the funnel)**: Nurture qualified leads in the pipeline and convert them into clients. Main KPI - % Conversion Rate & CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).

**BOFU (Bottom of the funnel)**: Increase MAU and retention by working with the Success Team to implement impacting campaigns to retain, activate and increase client trust.

**Key Performance Indicators**: Percentage of Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Lifetime Value LTV
