**OUR CORE VALUES**

&nbsp;

HOW WE ACT

1.  100% transparency, No Shenanigans 
    

Transparency goes beyond honesty: we are straightforward. As a company we have an open agenda. We are at our best when we collaborate, cooperate, and collectively take decisions together at every level within our organisation.

1.  Act like owners
    

Owners are  passionate, know their business inside and out. Owners take initiative and let their voices be heard. Owners sweat the details and “pick up the trash.” Owners think with vision and longevity, and go above and beyond to overcome challenges.

&nbsp;

HOW WE WIN

1.  Take initiatives
    

There’s no clear blueprint for success and instructions, it’s ours to write and figure it out. Build, ship, fix, improve and write it down.

1.  Shoot for the moon and don’t settle
    

Always expect the best from yourself and others, aim high with precision and go for it! Don’t settle for mediocrity.

1.  Don’t %#\*! with the customer
    

Our customers are our lifeline, we’re building products to delight customers and keep them happy. We listen, take notes and adjust based on customer demand and satisfaction.

&nbsp;

#### HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS

1.  Think like a customer
    

Always ask why and start first  to understand the customer’s journey and pain points, only then can we truly build amazing products. Find innovative solutions to delight our users with big impact.  
Come up with better ideas. Try new things.

1.  Obsessive prioritization
    

We are obsessed with high impact objectives, and to align our priorities with data driven decisions to impact  hyper growth for our company. Prioritization helps to break down complex problems, and provides clarity.
