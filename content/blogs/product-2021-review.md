Let's start from the beginning - 2021 

  

During 2021 Reloadly has reached great goals related to product development hand in hand with the engineering  Team! 

&nbsp;

**Reloadly is More Agile - Build, Break, and Fix Fast!!** 

  

Since January 2021 Reloadly pursues to work on agile methodologies for product development and continuous delivery of products, managing to strengthen communication and execution during different projects throughout the year and reinforcing the bases of iterative development and incremental delivery in Product development. 

  

Thanks to SCRUM and Kanban, the sprint velocity has been defined and tracked, we are capable of measuring how much work the team is capable of completing during 2 week sprints. 

  

Engineering and product have managed to deliver more than 700 story points, more than 100 bugs have been solved and we have managed to identify errors in processes with the purpose of being able to work in a more efficient and effective way.

  

We have also reinforced several personal assets such as the Ownership of each line of business and the commitment when it comes to solving problems, suggesting ideas and executing high-level decisions, which also impacts directly on each team metric.

**You want it you got it**

  

*   Airtime Widget: 
    

  

We have identified digital needs of users and companies that feel limited or intimate when hearing the Term API, Reloadly is the only player in the market that offer this amazing tool for all our users, with Low coding experience and with less that 10 clicks, our users are able to offer Airtime service in any website, which makes us offer one of the best solution on the market for this this kind of user. 

*   Airtime SDKs: 
    

  

Similar to our widget, but this time for Mid-high skilled companies and Developers, we identified the need from these two types of users to have a backend plug-&-play solution in different code languages like Java, PHP, .NET, IOS and others. Opening a new player in the market making the  “go-live” time lower for our clients. 

  

*   Airtime Routes: 
    

  

Our route Catalog has grown exponentially during this year, managing to complete more than 65% of planned integrations, leaving only 16 pending tasks to reduce the technical debt of the team to 0. 

  

Between Sales, engineering and product we have covered all Regions around the world with main and backup routes and with Direct and providers connections. 

  

*   Internal/external features improvements: 
    

  

In addition, product and engineering team delivered tools that help other departments to improve their KPIs, OKRs, process and SLAs in different aspects: 

  

1.  Airtime Auto-refund MVP.
    
2.  Admin Portal improvements
    
3.  Airtime formula improvements. 
    
4.  More dashboard to be more Data driven. 
    
5.  Notification systems - Bender. 
    
6.  Engineering and product tools: Launcher tool, microscope. 
    
7.  Quality assurance Automation. 
    
8.  New API documentation page. 
    
9.  New landing pages. 
    
10.  Customer success features (emails, Dashboards, and new data via Admin portal)
    
11.  PIN management 

&nbsp;

**No pain no gain.** 

  

*   Giftcards 
    

  

2021 has been a year of great commitments, we have launched a new digital product to promote a new line of business eGiftcards, The main goal is to grow the Reloadly’s product catalog and cover different types of customers, those interested in Airtime, also see an opportunity for commercial growth by offering digital gift cards. 

  

We have managed to define new APIs for this service, identified key suppliers and put this service into production in June 2021, achieving with them to fulfill some of the important milestones of this year for us, planting the seed that will grow one of the most important products of the company by 2022. 

  

*   Mobile Number Lookup Service:
    

  

This service is essential for us and especially for our users, it is an added value that helps a lot to improve the user experience and offer a quality service for our clients.

  

With Reloadly’s API and with a simple API request users are capable to identify operators around the world before the transaction is sent. 

  

This project along with gift cards are two fundamental pieces that put the Reloadly name on high. 

  
&nbsp;

**Now let's talk about 2022**

We have to be number 1 no matter w, our plan is to make a drastic turn in our website, improving the content, illustrations, UX/UI and being direct in what we offer. 

  

Marketing, engineering and product have in their hands the tools and talent to achieve this change. All with the purpose of attracting more users and being the most important digital service provider worldwide. 

  

*   Gift Cards:
    

  

From the product point of view, our proposal is to promote a small giant project that is Gift cards, taking into account three important branches: 

  

**Cover more business market**: integrating with better suppliers, having better coverage at the product level in more countries and optimizing the performance and availability of brands for our users. 

  

**Improve product transparency**: We need to improve the way users see our product, allowing them to quickly and easily identify the price of our entire catalog through the user portal. This also will improve sales operations allowing us to be more competitive and strong with all leads. 

  

**Better Communications tools**: along with Marketing and customer success, the main focus is to boost our tools in order to be able to reach more clients and to be number 1 gift card seller in the market. 

*   Utility payments: 
    

  

We want to expand our services by offering more technical solutions through our API. We want our clients to have everything at hand, and give them the tools to be able to offer bill payments for electricity, water, television and more. 

  

Despite the fact that this project was started in mid-summer 2021, we have encountered different obstacles that force us to continue this project in 2022. 

  

*   MoMo: 
    

  

Or as i called it “our manhattan project” - mobile money, it will mean a before and after to Reloadly. With the talent and a team dedicated exclusively to develop and deliver this solution, during 2022 we will be able to offer our users, mobile payments and collections through our API. 

  

*   Internal and external features/improvements: 
    

  

Product department has other important stakeholders (Sales, Customer support, finance, etc.) We want to continue developing features that help improve the processes of each department and some other important KPIs for the company.

  

Development and improvement proposals for 2022:

  

*   Promotions management for CS, Marketing and sales.
