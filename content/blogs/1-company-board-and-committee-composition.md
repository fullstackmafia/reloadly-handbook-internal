### Board Materials

Reloadly uses Google Drive, Google Sheet, Google Docs and email for the electronic dissemination and storage of materials relating to Reloadly’s Board Meetings.

&nbsp;

### Agenda

Prior to distributing the Board deck, the CFO or EBA to the CFO groups questions together in the BOD Meeting Agenda by function or topic. Notes should not be taken by any Reloadly team members in the agenda document during the meeting as requested by Legal. Key Board material is presented during Board Meeting sessions. This includes: The General Session Board deck (excluding the appendix or any pre-read slides, memos or videos) The Administration Session for Board Committee readouts by the Committee Chairperson updating the Board as to the Committee’s activities and highlighting the items requiring Board approval, if any. Questions can be asked throughout the meeting. 30 minutes are reserved at the end of the General Session for Q&A / Discussion. At the conclusion of the General Session the E-Group, Observers, CoS to the CEO, Staff EBA, CEO Shadows depart the zoom meeting and the full Board shall meet for a Closed Session.

&nbsp;

### Board Deck

*   The deck should start with a CEO Overview section which includes: list of up to ten Reloadly KPIs. These should reflect the team’s prioritizations. The expectation is that these metrics will be on the list for a year or longer. The CEO Overview will also include slides on: prior quarter or fiscal year overview, trends, challenges, opportunities and current fiscal year priorities.
    
*   The deck highlights 1-3 key asks for Board input during the meeting. Each ask should have a few key slides that provide historical context, current status, and plans for the future. We strive to have 3 or less key asks. At least 20 minutes should be spent on these topics. The key asks are typically presented during the meeting and may include team members from across the organization to join the meeting.
    
*   The deck includes a Sales and Marketing section composed of: an executive summary slide on OKRs and key learnings, prior quarter review, upcoming quarter and fiscal year outlook. It may also include a competitive landscape update and any other relevant key updates.
    
*   The deck includes an R&D section composed of: an executive summary slide on OKRs and key learnings, R&D investments, product themes, efficiency drivers, revenue drivers, and any other key updates.
    
*   The deck includes a People Group section composed of: Attrition and General Update.
    
*   The deck should strive to not exceed 10 slides per individual function
    
*   Slides should convey a high-level overview as opposed to operational updates and will not include embedded links.
    
*   Put information on public webpages such as /strategy as much as possible.
    
*   Sensitive information goes into the Administration deck managed by the CFO.
    
*   Font size should be minimum 16pt, footnotes excluded. We want to make sure everything can be read.
    
*   Every slide should have a title which provides the key takeaway from that slide.
    
&nbsp;

### Sales Slides

The Sales Slides should always include: An overview of segment and geographic success A sales overview including revenue, % of plan, growth versus last year and other key metrics

&nbsp;

### Finance Presentation

The Finance slides are as follows:

*   Review past quarter and YTD: Bookings review (growth rates) / new/growth and by sales zone
    
*   Review past quarter and YTD: P&L vs plan with commentary
    
*   Review past quarter and YTD: Revenue deep dive
    
*   Review past quarter and YTD: Gross Margin deep dive
    
*   Review past quarter and YTD: Cash waterfall
    
*   Forward looking: Rolling forecast that we will hold company accountable to in next quarter with commentary
    
*   Forward looking: Cash projection through end of year
    
*   Forward looking: LR plan adjustments with commentary
    
*   Forward looking: Balance sheet projection to match the 4Q Forecast
    
&nbsp;

### Board Dinner

We usually will host a Board Dinner on the evening before a Board Meeting. The EBA to the CEO is responsible for coordinating this dinner. Board Members, Local E-Group members, special invites are all optional attendees. Each quarter, E-Group can invite an additional team member as a Key Talent Guest. At least a month before the dinner, the CoS to the CEO will gather nominations and ensure that E-Group has identified an invitee. Criteria for consideration includes:

*   Key Talent
    
*   High performance
    
*   Clear results
    
*   Function (should have representation across functions throughout the year)
    
*   Diversity (participation from members in Reloadly Team Member Resource Groups Once the Key Talent Guest has been identified, the EBA to the CEO will confirm that the guest is able to join. If not, the invite will go to the runner up. Once a Key Talent Guest is confirmed, the EBA to the CEO should enter their name in the Key Talent guest list. Reloadly will cover this person's travel expenses. A person's location will not be considered in the selection criteria though the person's travel must be allowed under Reloadly's travel policies and guidelines.
    

As part of joining the dinner, the Key Talent Guest should come prepared to discuss:

*   Their background (both at Reloadly and before joining)
    
*   What they have accomplished thus far at Reloadly
    
*   What their plans are both now and in the future and what they see as a future for themselves at Reloadly Though no formal presentation is required, the Key Talent Guest should advise on how they want to discuss these topics with the Board and E-Group and coordinate with the EBA to the CEO. The CEO to the EBA will ensure that the Key Talent Guest has dedicated time at the dinner.
