**Quarterly Cadence Kick-off**

Every quarter, key members of the Reloadly team in product, sales, marketing, engineering and customer success meet re-align goals. This is an opportunity for the T team members to sync on business outcomes, priorities, progress on initiatives, and concerns, and it is a great opportunity to bring in other Reloadly team members that the managers feel should be included.

Cadence calls are an important aspect of the company's operating rhythm to continue to understand customer's evolving needs, ensure Reloadly is delivering value and outcomes, unblock barriers, address issues, collect feedback, nurture relationships, and ensure the customer continues to have positive experiences. It also sets a precedent for everyone to have skin in the game and commit to deadlines.

&nbsp;

**Frequency**
-------------

*   **First Tuesday of the new quarter**: Cadence calls should be quarterly.
    
*   **Time**: Cadence calls should be a minimum of 2 hours
    
&nbsp;

**Items to cover**
------------------

**Sales and finance system**

*   Plan quarterly sales targets and assign new sales plans. Avoid annual plans and things might change and monthly targets are too volatile for our business model. Sales goals should be tied in with revenue expansion and number of new accounts live.
    

1.  Month 1: sales kickoff and targets
    
2.  Month 2: Pipeline inspection & marketing push with product, pricing updates to drive conversion
    
3.  Month 3: Heads down closing
    

*   Review commissions, bonuses and spiffs
    
*   Align sales and marketing with expected leads, targets, segments
    
*   Training on product, best practices, sharing what worked and didn’t work
    
*   Sales to be aligned with financial fiscal calendar: **February - January**
    

&nbsp;  

**Marketing and Product system**

Product

*   Focus on quarterly major releases rather than shipping sand. Wh:at are the big ticket items ‘rocks’ that can fill out our jar, then pebbles and sand.
    
*   Ship daily, weekly
    
*   Big features MVP: ratios aligned with 2-10 engineers, 2-10 weeks max
    
*   Set major product release deadlines with engineering, and alignment with marketing 
    

  

Marketing

*   Organize quarterly product launch events: this should be set in stone with product deadlines. 
    
*   Communicate launch event 4 weeks prior to deadline
    
*   Organize press release for new major product launch, set the date and invitations 2 weeks in advance to product release
    
*   External communication deadlines, feeds off better internal communication and alignment

**Lifecycle of a cadence call**
-------------------------------

An effective cadence call involves more than just the call itself. There are several stages that occur before, during, and after the call.

&nbsp;

### **Preparation for the call**

Leading up to a cadence call, the Heads of each department should prepare a meeting agenda. This is the foundation of an effective call, and should be collaborated on by all attendees. The agenda should be made available to everyone at least a few days in advance of the meeting.

&nbsp;

#### **Agenda: 2hrs**

*   Recap of previous quarter performance - **10m**
    
*   Product deliverables Q2 - Major features ‘Rocks’ and deadlines **20m** 
    
*   Marketing alignment for leads and PR, features to market **20m**
    
*   Event launch deadline, press release and marketing initiatives **10m**
    
*   Sales quotas: Regional & per AM/AE **20m**
    
*   Review commissions and bonus structure, Spiffs **10m**
    
*   Customer success: revenue expansion and championing newly live customers **10m**
    
*   Training: product, sales techniques, what worked and didn't  **20m**
    
*   Closing QA **5m**
    

&nbsp;

### **Conducting the call**

The CEO will kickoff the session by highlighting some important topics and KPIs, and adjustments if needed. The meeting itself should be a comfortable and valuable experience for everyone involved. The department Heads should be prepared to conduct the meeting according to the agenda and cover all of the listed discussion points. This is our chance to help the customer make forward progress on their objectives by sharing our expertise and answering their questions!

The TAM should drive the call proactively so the customer sees a value in it. Try to ask questions to get into discussions and let the customer talk most of the time. When putting together the call agenda, ensure that you are covering topics that help you with your customer strategy, but also ask yourself "if I were the customer, would I find this relevant?"

*   **Be engaged.** During a cadence call it isn't a good idea to multitask. The CEO is leading this call, and it's important to follow what is being discussed and keep the conversation moving to make the most of the alloted time. The CEO should be guiding the discussion, and taking notes (or have already asked another member of the team to take notes).
    
*   **Be flexible.** Having an agenda is crucial to a well run cadence call, but it's equally important to be ready to go off-script. 
    
*   **Be responsive.** We encourage collaboration and feedback loop during the call
    
&nbsp;

Before you end the call, the CEO will take a few minutes to summarize the highlights of what was discussed, and review the action items and who is responsible for each of them. It's also worth reminding everyone of when the _next_ cadence call is.

&nbsp;
### **After the call**

**If there are no action items or follow-ups that come from a cadence call, the call was not effective.** At minimum, the CEO should send a follow-up email or create a follow-up issue for the participants covering the summary information that was discussed at the end of the call, answer any questions that were posed during the call, and make sure everyone knows what the action items from the call were.
