_**Office**_

*   Office working hours are flexible. Standard Work starts at 9am or 10am Monday to Friday and finishes at 18h or 19h.
    
*   We will set a code number for you to get in your fingerprint as well.
    
*   Whoever leaves the office last should ensure that all tv screens, windows and blinds are closed and that the lights and air conditioning are turned off.
    
*   Leave the office nice and tidy when you leave. Bins out, cutlery washed. 
    

&nbsp;

**Printing**

Print in black & white / greyscale as normal. Only use color ink if necessary. Try to keep printing to a minimum and reuse any paper you can. If you can, print 2 pages on each sheet (this can be done by adjusting the printer settings before printing).

&nbsp;

**Outside Guests**

*    You are more than welcome to have outside guests for meetings, lunches, etc.
    
*    If your guest will be working out of the Reloadly office for more than 1 day please let us know in advance. Registration is mandatory in that case.
    
&nbsp;

*    If you wish to decorate your area with additional furniture, signage, frames, etc. please run it by our team for approval.
    
*   Feel free to post pictures or picture frames strictly around your work space

###  **Events**

You are more than welcome to host an event in our space. Please reach out to our team to schedule it in advance and we will help with what we can.

If you would like to place an anonymous complaint or comment you can do so in our suggestion box located in the office. Feel free to speak your mind and we will do our best to address the situation or issue. Thank you!

&nbsp;

###  **Noise**

*    No phone calls should be taken at your desk. Please use the café, meeting rooms.
    
*   No music in the working areas. Please use headphones.
    
*   Always be respectful of other teams and limit loud conversations and brainstorms in the working area.
    
&nbsp;

###  **Smell**

Please do not eat any food in the working areas in order to avoid bothersome or lingering smells.

*   To be courteous to other teams please do not light any candles or incense.
    
&nbsp;

###  **Cleanliness**

*   Please keep your work area and communal areas clean. Use the provided recycling trash.
    
*   If you have large items to throw away such as cardboard boxes please walk them down to the proper trash containers.
    
&nbsp;

### **Dress Code**

 Because each Employee is a representative of the Company in the eyes of the public, you should always report to work properly groomed and wearing appropriate clothing. Team Members are expected to dress neatly and in a manner consistent with the nature of our business and the type of work performed.

&nbsp;

### ***Kitchen***

1.  **Keep it clean.** Remember that you are one of many. Take your time to put your trash in the garbage bin, wipe up any spills, and remove whatever you brought in that day. Avoid floor hazards. If you spill something, clean it up. You don't want to be responsible for someone slipping and falling. Don't forget to test it after you wipe it clean. If there is any sticky or slimy residue, clean it again.  
    If you see that something is almost empty, please **fill it** or **replace** it.
    

2\. Let the Human Resources team know when the kitchen staples and supplies run low so they can **order** more before it’s late. 

3\. Respect refrigerator real estate. When you have a large group of people using the same refrigerator, **space** becomes valuable. Only refrigerate what needs to be kept cold. 

**4\. Only eat and drink what is yours**. No matter how tempting another employee's soda appears, it doesn't belong to you, so [don't take it](https://www.thespruce.com/etiquette-of-borrowing-1216917). 

Exception: Food marked “**Help yourself**” is fair game. 

**5\. Label your food**. Write your name in bold letters to make sure there is no doubt about who your food or drink belongs to. 

**6\. Remove your food before it spoils**. Ideally you should only use the refrigerator for what you plan to eat that day, according to safety reasons. However, there may be times when you'll need to keep your lunch or drink there for the next day. Drinks can be kept for longer since they don’t stink but all food must be taken out by the end of the week. This means that if you are not coming on Friday, everything has to be taken out by Thursday afternoon before you leave. Anything left for next week will be binned.

  
7\. Leave **appliances** as you found them or better than you found them. When heating any food or beverage in the microwave oven, **ALWAYS cover** it with a lid or a paper towel. And if you’ve still managed to splatter food or liquid, wipe it immediately.

  
8\. **Never leave your dirty dishes** or silverware in the sink. Put them in the washing machine. Check it out if it’s full and switch it on

  
9\. When the **bin** is full, close the bag, remove it from the bin and head to the nearer **container** on the street.
