&nbsp;

As an Onboarding Specialist, you focus on receiving our newly registered users and making sure they have everything they need to go live. To do so, you need to have an understanding of not only product and industry knowledge, but also sales soft skills, and internal tools and processes. This handbook page will act as a guide to those topics as well as general information about the Onboarding team.

&nbsp;

Training
========

In your first month at Reloadly we want to help ensure you have everything you need to be successful in your job. You will go through enablement videos, live sessions and activities covering a wide range of getting started topics.

&nbsp;

## Goal of the Onboarding Training

As an Onboarding Specialist, you work closely with the sales and SDR teams. Due to this, your training will encompass training on tools and processes related to not only your role but a blend of sales, soft skills and product knowledge.

This learning experience involves virtual self-paced learning paths in the form of a general company-wide onboarding bootcamp, an onboarding specific training, to prep you for your onboarding quick start. In parallel, you will meet regularly with your manager, onboarding buddy and members of our onboarding enablement team to chat through and dig a bit deeper into the topics within your onboarding.

The goal in all of this is to ensure that you feel confident and comfortable to hit the ground running at the start of your second month on the job when you will have a ramped bonus. Our hope is that along this journey you are not only gaining the tactical skills needed to complete your job, but that you form connections with colleagues, gain a strong understanding of our culture, and begin to develop industry knowledge.

## SDR Onboarding Process

The People Team initiates a general Reloadly onboarding bootcamp for every new Reloadly team member. On your first day, you will receive a welcome email with steps to get started and invitations to your onboarding bootcamp training sessions. You will also meet with your manager.

You will receive an email giving you access to Pipedrive, Zoom and specific training on how the CS-Onboarding funnel works. 

During your second week, you will ramp up your Pipedrive, Webinar and Onboarding skills getting ready to land your first demo call.

Internal Onboarding Processes
=============================

The Onboarding Specialist function will work mainly with Pipedrive as an onboarding administration tool to always keep up to date the states of every new registered user.

&nbsp;

## Pipedrive CS-Onboarding Funnel Stages

&nbsp;

Pipedrive SDR Funnel has the following stages:

**Registered User**: all registered users from the admin portal ready to start the onboarding process.

**Demo Scheduled**: Registered users that have scheduled a demo via Calendly invite

**Demo Done**: Registered users that have attended their demo

**Integration:** Registered users that have attended the demo meeting and are moving forward with the integration

**Onboarded:** Registered users that have sent at least 25 live transactions

&nbsp;

After the meeting is attended, if the deal value corresponds to Tier 2 or Tier 1 accounts, the Onboarding Specialist will duplicate the deal into the Sales funnel, assign it to the regional account manager and continue to follow up with them until the deal is live.
