&nbsp;


We have different kind of offsite meetings depending on who is attending.

&nbsp;

Schedule
--------

  
Executive offsite: The off-site is a yearly meeting scheduled over 2-3 days (including travel time). Scheduling for the in-person event generally follows:

1.  Travel Day: travel day with optional dinner around 7pm local time (usually Monday).
    
2.  First Day: Full day meeting starting with breakfast at 8am (usually Tuesday)
    
3.  Second Day: Full day meeting starting with breakfast at 8am.
    
4.  Third Day: Half day meeting starting with breakfast at 8am. Usual end time is 12:30 pm with departure flights scheduled in the late afternoon (usually Thursday).
    

Sales Acceleration offsite: The offsite is a yearly meeting scheduled over 2 days (not including travel time). It normally occurs at the end or beginning of the year.

&nbsp;

Prep Work
---------

Because the offsite is a very expensive meeting, we want to be sure we are as efficient as possible. One of the ways we do this is by asking participants to do prep work ahead of time. Examples of prep work include:

*   Reading the content that was selected
    
*   Executives working with their HR Manager, CEO, COO or other Câ€™s involved to prep the main points and issues that need to be tackled.
    

Anyone who is presenting for a topic should share materials with the prep work. Prep work should be shared at least one business day before.

Guidance for invited participants
---------------------------------

There are a number of reasons why participants are invited to join specific offsite meetings. These can range from giving team members a chance for greater context to expecting an invited participant to lead a discussion. Before you attend the offsite, please:

1.  Understand expectations for your participation
    
2.  Ensure that you have context about what is being discussed. If you are invited to a meeting and don't have context, proactively start an async conversation or schedule a 15 minute meeting with the responsible and other participants. You should not need to attend a meeting without knowing what will be discussed or do any pre-work without clear direction
    
3.  Don't spend hours preparing unless there is a direct ask to do so
