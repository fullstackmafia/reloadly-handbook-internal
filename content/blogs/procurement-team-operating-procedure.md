*   Do NOT agree to ANY business, legal, and or pricing prior to engaging the procurement team.
    
*   This ensures alignment across the multiple functions to make good-faith commitments to vendors and don’t put our company into possible risk.
    
&nbsp;

How Is a New Provider selected?

*   Once you've chosen your new provider follow these instructions:
    
    1.  Initial call to assess provider viability.
        
    2.  Determine coverage.
        
    3.  Review Contract and make sure terms are satisfactory, then pass it on to our legal department for review.
        
    4.  Negotiate Payment Terms.
        
    5.  Review Commercial and make sure they are competitive, include finance team for LCR
        
    6.  Request API documentation, included Engineering team for feedback and approval
        
    7.  Head of procurement will request CEO or COO approval to sign agreement.
        
    8.  Once previous 6 steps are done and approved, pass along API info and pricing to PM for:
