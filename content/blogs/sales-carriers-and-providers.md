**Strategic Plan** 
===================

This category will be the main point of contact and responsible for build and develop relationships with providers including carriers across all the regions.  

  

Consistently identify and negotiate new opportunities, markets  or business lines (Mobile Wallets, Bill payments, Bilateral alliances etc.)  while supporting and increasing traffic for existing agreements with carriers & providers 

Provide accurate and timely carriers updates, reporting and forecasts to take decisions and lead the internal communication to drive overall success in the go to market plan. 

&nbsp;

**Planned tactic actions** 

  

1.  **Structure & performance management:**   A team to develop business relationships and business plans with carrier & providers  that maximizes Reloadly advantages  to compite  into different segments in all regions. 
    

Drive any opportunity or challenge in the market that could impact our customer service and traffic. Also manage the visibility of Reloadly sales performance according to internal expectations and commitments in the agreements to avoid disputes or canceled contracts. 

1.  **Initiatives to prioritize our direct connections:** Currently +80% traffic is going through third party provider but most of our live direct connections doesn’t match with our demanded routes. (Annex Table 1) 
    

Implementing an aggressive direct agreements plan based in our Top 20 corridors and accelerate the integration process will help Reloadly to improve our cost and GM ~ 4%,  better quality service and pricing proposals.  

1.  **Best practices to generate traffic for live connections:**  The first key step is to identify the big accounts that have an existing demand for our direct connections, that will help us to growth revenues and carrier targets in the short term, also determinate new use cases or segments with potential traffic such as: Exchange, games, rewards, crypto currencies, etc. 
    

Then prepare a go to market plan  based in the diaspora corridor for every operator and a marketing initiatives for our tier 1 leads and to upsell existing accounts.
