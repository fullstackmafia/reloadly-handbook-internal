&nbsp;

3\. ONBOARDING PERFORMANCE FOLLOW UP
------------------------------------

&nbsp;

**Before moving to everyone’s fulltime role, new employees need to close 5 tickets to be qualified**.

After the onboarding process is completed, the new employee has a one-on-one with the HR team where their feedback and personal views of the onboarding and the company are sought after. Questions that are asked may include:

*   _How satisfied were you with the onboarding in general?_
    
*   _The information given before arrival_
    
*   _Who would you say is your knowledgeable point of contact in the company?_
    
*   _What could have made your first day better?_
    
*   _How would you rate the preparation of manager? The team? Reloadly?_
    
*   _Is there any additional introduction and training for internal systems and general operating practices you feel you may need?_
    
*   _Are there any specific tools or training sessions that you think would help you be more successful?_
    
*   _Do you feel like you’ve received access to all of the information, tools, and resources you need to complete your responsibilities?_
    
*   _Is there anything missing?_
    
*   _What would you like to accomplish in the next 30 days?_
    
*   _If a friend of yours was going to start working with your organization, what would you tell them to expect during their first day and week?_
    
*   _Describe your onboarding process in one sentence_
    
*   _How likely are you to recommend your organization as an employer after your first weeks on the job?_
    

&nbsp;

During the new employee's first quarter at Reloadly, a monthly follow-up is conducted by the HR team - usually with the employee's manager. This is to ensure that the employee's initial expectations as well as other needs are being met. Discussions may include:

*   _What’s going well so far? Describe some of your best experiences._
    
*   _Is this role what you thought it would be? How has it differed from your initial expectations?_
    
*   _Are you experiencing any challenges in particular that we can assist you with?_
    
*   _Do you have enough time to do your work? Do you have too much or too little time?_
    
*   _How can I help you learn and improve? How can the organization support your growth and success?_
    
*   _Do you feel you have the information, tools, and resources you need to do your job successfully?_
    
*   _Are you comfortable asking questions about work? Who do you ask? Are there any introductions we can make?_
    
*   _Are you feeling comfortable within the organization in general? Do you feel like you have a good understanding of your role within the organization?_
    
*   _Is our organization’s mission clear, and do you see how your job supports that mission?_
    
*   _Do you have any suggestions for, or do you see any weaknesses in specific systems, processes, and procedures that the organization can improve?_
