Attendance Policy
=====================================

&nbsp;

In this section, you can find Reloadly’s rules for employee attendance. It covers situations such as absenteeism, tardiness, sick leave, vacation, and appointments. Reloadly believes that it is important to have the chance to take some time off when needed but every employee must be mindful of the responsibilities of their role, and their importance to their team.

When planning time off, employees should consider the work they are committed to delivering and propose to their manager a plan of action for their absence (e.g. who will absorb their work while they are out of office, how will this impact their team members, any goals they have set for that quarter, etc.). Employees are responsible for presenting their coverage plans to their managers and managers should take this information into account prior to approving time off.

As Reloadly is a worldwide company, we are first going to explain the general concepts related to attendance and time off policies and then we will specify all details and numbers that apply to every country you may be working from. We are implementing a platform on Factorial - an all-in-one human resource management software. With Factorial, we manage all these items and centralize information and requests, clock in, surveys, documents, etc.

You will get a notification when it is all set, from that point: All requests must go through this platform, besides contacting the relevant person for each issue to be aware of and discussed when needed.

In the event of absence of Factorial software: Any application must be sent to HR department indicating:

*   Your Name and Surname
    
*   Department
    
*   Manager in line
    
*   Reason for request
    
*   Dates
    
*   Attach certificate/documentation if needed
    

&nbsp;

ATTENDANCE
----------

The company recognizes that an occasional absence may occur. An employee’s absence will be considered excused if covered by policy and the employee provides proper and timely notification deemed satisfactory to their Manager or HR department, as well as always managing this absence through Factorial platform attaching the corresponding documentation. Timely notification means calling in on the day of absence or providing advance notice for absences which can be anticipated.

An employee’s absence will be deemed unexcused when an employee has no justification, fails to call in, gives a late notice, fails to give advance notice for an absence which could be anticipated. Unexcused absences are subject to **corrective discipline or termination** as defined in policies on discipline and separation of employment.

Excessive absenteeism is defined as two or more instances of unexcused absence in a calendar month. Such excessive absenteeism is subject to corrective discipline. Any eight instances of unexcused absenteeism in a calendar year are considered grounds for discharge.

&nbsp;

PAID TIME OFF (PTO)
-------------------

It is paid time off from work that employees can use for personal matters. Employees might request PTO to take a vacation, visit with family/friends, go to a doctor’s appointment, or simply stay home and recharge.

*   Only employees who have been working in Reloadly for at least 3 months are entitled to request vacations. Before the probationary period ends it is not permitted.
    
*   The notice period to request holidays is 1 month, minimum, in advance so everything can be organised and set.
    
*   The Company’s holiday year runs from Jan 1st to December 31st. Any untaken entitlement will be carried over to the following year, up to the 31st of March. Any untaken day after this date will be lost.
    
*   Each department’s manager will study and approve the requests. This means that the manager has to:
    
    *   Check who else is off during the requested dates. Depending on the team you belong to we’ll have to take into consideration the following:
        
        *   For the Integration team: Only one person can be off at a time.
            
        *   For the Product developers team: Only two people can be off at the same time. Also, there are employees in the engineering team who can not be off at the same time due to the functions they undertake (Front-end engineering team)
            
    *   For the Customer Success team: Only one person can be off at a time. - For the Sales team:
        
    *   At our Miami office, there can only be one person at a time.
        
    *   Also, there are employees in the sales/procurement team who can not be off at the same time due to the functions they undertake: (Vice-Presidents of the Sales and Procurements teams respectively)
        
    *   Check if there is any important deployment/task to be completed by the requester and assess if it can be done by the rest of the team or not.

### CHECKING AN EMPLOYEE'S CALENDAR

&nbsp;

![](https://reloadly-handbook.netlify.app/pages/human-resources-team/images/checking-an-employees-calendar.png)

Only in exceptional cases will apply: With prior approval, employees are permitted to take PTO days before they have accrued the proper balance, which may result in a short term negative PTO balance. To qualify for the negative PTO exception, both the employee’s manager and HR must approve.

If the employee leaves the company with a negative PTO balance, the difference will be deducted from the employee’s final salary/settlement. All leave must be pre-authorized by the Company. Taking leave without authorization will be considered a gross misconduct offence.

Taking leave despite a declined request will be considered a gross misconduct offence. Gross misconduct offences may result in dismissal without notice.

&nbsp;

### PAID LEAVE (“_Permisos_”)

Paid Leave is a long-term leave during which the employee can be paid by the company or the social security for a variety of reasons such as parental leave, long-term injury, illness, or public duty or marriage.

&nbsp;

#### **Sick Leave**

Paid Sick Leave is time off for employees to be used for their personal medical treatment. On the employee’s second day of sick leave, the employee, unless there is an obvious and justified impossibility, must arrange an appointment with medical personnel of the public health service or mutual society (Médico de cabecera - Family doctor) and request a sick leave medical certificate.

Once the employee has received the medical certificate, they must send it through Factorial within the three (3) business days following its issuance. To send it: Go to **My documents** in the left side of your Dashboard Factorial account - Click on the **My Family and Medical Leaves** folder - once In the folder, click on the top right corner: + Upload documents - Drag your justification or click to select it - Click on **Send notification to Sonia** - Upload document.

![](https://reloadly-handbook.netlify.app/pages/human-resources-team/images/family-and-medical-leave-2.png)

The sick leave medical certificate will contain the data regarding the sick leave: the employee's details, the date on which sick leave began, the contingency that caused the sickness or injury, the estimated duration of the process and, if applicable, the date of the next medical examination. The employee must attend ongoing medical appointments as requested by the doctor in order to determine whether they will remain on sick leave, and for how long.

If the employee must remain on sick leave, the doctor will issue a sick leave confirmation medical certificate (_Parte de confirmación de baja_), while if an employee is medically discharged, the doctor will issue a discharge medical certificate (_Parte médico de alta_).

Whether the employee continues on medical leave or is discharged, the employee must send the medical certificate provided by the doctor to HR department so that Human Resources may process it with social security, within the following periods:

*   In case of sick leave confirmation medical certificate: three (3)business days following its issuance;
    
*   In case of discharge medical certificate: twenty-four (24) business hours following its issuance; or
    
*   In case of very short disability, the doctor issues the sick leave medical certificate and the discharge medical certificate at the same time: twenty-four (24) business hours following the discharge.
    
&nbsp;

#### **Requested hours off for medical appointments**

Click on the left bar side: **Time off**, then on the top right corner: **+Request time off** and fill up the information asked:

*   Type of absence: Various
    
*   Description: Describe the appointment you have, the time it is scheduled and the time you will be absent.
    
*   Choose if it’s a whole day or half day (for hours) and then the date. Click on **Request**.
    

Requesting half day

![](https://reloadly-handbook.netlify.app/pages/human-resources-team/images/requesting-half-days.png)

The company will send the medical certificate to the Social Security National Institute ("_Instituto Nacional de la Seguridad Social_") no later than 3 business days after receiving the report from the employee.

&nbsp;

### OUT OF OFFICE SLACK SET UP

Same as email, employees need to set up their Slack status to let people know they won’t reply.

*   **Announce your status**: Let everyone know where you are and when you’ll be back by updating your custom status a few days before your planned departure, and during your time off. It appears everywhere your name does, including your user profile and any message you’ve sent in Slack. Illustrate it with an emoji to indicate that you’re offline or taking a road trip, and let people know the date when you’ll return in the status text.
    
    How to do it?
    
    *   From your computer, click on your name in the upper-left corner of your sidebar, then select "Set a status". On our mobile apps, tap the You option on the bottom tab bar, then edit your status directly from there.
        
    *   You can also set the expiration date and time of your message, so that your vacation status, for example, disappears when you’re back to work.
        
*   **Leave notes in reminders**: Reminders in Slack are exactly that—messages reminding you or someone else to do anything you need at any future time or date you choose. Set them before you leave to remind yourself to do various things when you return, or ask others to set them for you if anything comes up while you’re gone. You can always ask Slack to remind you later about a particular message or conversation.
