&nbsp;

WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN

● Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,  
especially after you’ve been in a public place, or after blowing  
your nose, coughing, or sneezing.  
● If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that  
contains at least 60% alcohol.  
● Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they  
feel dry.

&nbsp;

AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FACE

● Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, especially with  
unwashed hands.  
● Your eyes, nose, and mouth are entryways for viruses into your  
body. If you touch an infected surface and then touch your face  
you could potentially become infected and get sick.

&nbsp;

WEAR A FACE COVERING

● Everyone should wear a mask while interacting with each other.  
● While working from your desk and keeping distance from others it  
is fine to not wear it.

&nbsp;

COVER COUGHS AND SNEEZES

● If you’re in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face  
covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a  
tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow.  
● Throw used tissues in the trash.  
● Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.  
If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a  
hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

&nbsp;

PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING

● If you attend a meeting in person, be sure to keep one meter  
distance with other people.  
● If this social distancing isn't possible, or for further protection,  
wear a mask.  
● If you need to work near or talk to a co-worker, stay one meter far.  
If you need to be in closer contact, wear a mask.

&nbsp;

● To stay at home when you feel sick and think it may be COVID  
● Communicate to the HR department and your manager ASAP  
● Call to your doctor and get checked / PCR test and quarantine
