**360-Degree Performance Appraisal Feedback Program**
=========================================================

&nbsp;

360-Degree Performance Appraisal Feedback is a review process where employees anonymously give or receive feedback from those who work with them.

The purpose of this program is to effectively drive development and help people recognize their strengths and weaknesses and areas of improvement from colleagues who work with them closely. Strengths and weaknesses of all employees are recorded regularly so that the organization can make informed and accurate decisions regarding an employee's contribution, career development, training needs, promotional opportunities, pay increases and other topics.

360-Degree feedback benefits leadership, teams, and the entire organization immediately. 

We will have a template per role with soft skills and hard skills to assess. Soft skills are company-wide, everybody needs to have them and then, every role has their specific hard skills which every manager in line has to update.

The general template: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETGJsGtgwSGu3NeReY\_LrpW1hxtgf7pa/edit#gid=1034144576](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETGJsGtgwSGu3NeReY_LrpW1hxtgf7pa/edit#gid=1034144576)

**BENEFITS**:

**Procedure**
    

We will be conducting this review bi-annually and under any specific circumstances that requires it. 

We will implement this program through a new tool we are working on. It will be 100% anonymous so we would not know who scored what.

1.  In the meantime, the reviewers will receive an email with the template attached with the information of the employee to be assessed and their position and expected scores. 
    
2.  Download the template
    
3.  Score each of the skills mentioned in
    
4.  Add any notes, highlights and areas that you think need improvement.
    
5.  Save it and send it via email to Sonia. 
    

Nobody else will know who scored what, just me so far while we implement the new tool.

Thanks for your cooperation, this is for the sake of everyone, to achieve the better version of ourselves!
