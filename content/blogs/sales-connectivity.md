 Highlight the achievements, improvements, etc from 2021 / Share some relevant data from 2021

*   AM from carrier team - Reloadly revenue under account management by carrier team = 75% 
    

*   Focus has primarily been on sales / account management
    

*   Next steps, ideas, plans: 2022
    

  

*   Hire LATAM carrier manager / trading 
    

  

*   Hire S Asia carrier manager / trading (APAC S Asia and E Asia different) 
    

  

*   Maybe hire MENA carrier / trading
    

  

*   Focus on ‘bullet proofing’ routing network. Minimum 2 options for top 30 corridors and focus on directs for these. 
    

  

*   Directs - Still pursue due to longer term value but work with Tulita / sales to focus resources on driving traffic to them - Airtel Ghana Example
    
*   Directs outside of current top 20 corridors (i.e. key industry directs but currently not big for Reloadly) , Nepal, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Iraq
    

*   Develop bilaterals / trading (DTOne, CSQ, Sochitel, Kumquot - Next PPN & Tranglo) Target 2022 1M MRR 
    
*   New niche markets on horizon - Sudan / Cuba black market Fx… Mobile money via SIMs
    
*   Sales to Telcos in sending corridors. APAC taking lead here, ME several conversations managed by sales team. LATAM / Africa need to develop
    

*   **Problems / What is needed to better manage / Scale** - Monitoring quality - solution have proper quality metric stats in moesif (linked to getting THEN MAINTAINING traffic on directs)
    

  

*   Monitoring balance - solution have alarm set up when > 1,000 $ (linked to getting THEN MAINTAINING traffic on directs). Alert out of balance (Car - Low fuel vs Out of Fuel warning)
    

  

*   Loss of traffic (linked to getting THEN MAINTAINING traffic on directs) - better contextualized reporting on sales.
