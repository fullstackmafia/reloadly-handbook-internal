| **OKRs**                                                                   | **Achievement** | **Notes** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Form a Solid Sales-driven growth team**                                     |                 |           |
| Q1 Goal: Build a pipeline of qualified leads to reach $5M MRR projections  | 105%            |By the end of Q1, we’d surpassed our pipeline goal of $5M MRR in total by 5%.  <br/><br/> Now, at the end of 2021, we have deals currently in the “Integration” stage alone that represent over $4.5M MRR. <br/><br/> Pipeline deals currently under “Negotiation” represent an additional $9M+ MRR, and <br/><br/> Pipeline deals in “Early Engagement” represent another $7.2M MRR in potential          |
| Close 6 key accounts with an average of $75k ARPU                          |50%             | Since the beginning of 2021, we’ve only launched 6 new accounts with a greater than $50K impact each. <br/><br/> Some other, more recent launches (like blockstore and Unipay), have yet to ramp up their impact          |
| Hold 8 training sessions with team on best practices for closing deals     | 75%             |  We began to do this early in Q1 but have not kept the practice constant throughout the year. <br/><br/>It’s a good practice to revive but only with a narrow, specific “practice” per session. General sessions of overall “best practices” would likely not be particularly impactful.         |
| **Increase Monthly Sales Volumes**                                            |                 |           |
| Q1 Goal: Recruit 3 more sales members to our team (USA, Middle East, etc.)<br/><br/>Q2 Goal: Stand up a team of 4 new, qualified people in sales, support & marketing |                 |  We’ve actually grown the sales team by a headcount of 5 this year, not including our recent restructuring.<br/><br/>The Customer Success & Marketing teams have grown by another 5        |
| Q1 Goal: Increase monthly sales from $1.375M to $1.875M                                                                           |       70%          |  We were 30 percent below our target revenue target for Q1 and after a few months ahead of target and a few months below, we’re actually ending the year at about the same 30 percent deficit.<br/><br/>We’ve grown nearly $1M MRR over the course of the year but we’re still short of our $3M MRR, expecting to finish the year with about $2.3M in Dec.         |
|    Q1 Goal: Increase online sign-up conversions from 4% to 8%<br/><br/>Q2 Goal: Increase online sign-up conversions from 6% to 10%                                                                       |    100%             |  Our conversion percentage actually reached as high as 11% by April 2021 but the metric became distorted in August.<br/><br/>This metric needs to be cleaned up in our recurring reporting and dashboards         |
| **Improve our Operational Processes**                                                                           |                 |           |
|   Produce an operations manual wiki work process for 4 departments (Engineering, Opps, Commercial, & Product)                                                                         |   62.5%              |    Customer Care Ops and Product manuals were done in Q1. Sales was only half finished by then.<br/><br/>Engineering was developed independently.       |
|  Implement 18hr/24hr tech support & close tikets within 2hrs                                                                          |  100%               |     Done<br/><br/>Next stage: 24/7      |
|   **Rockstar Revenue Growth**                                                                        |                 |           |
|   By Q3 &Q4 we’d evolved the Biz Dev portion of the Sales’ Team OKRs to the below targets: <br/><br/>      200 pre-screened qualified leads                                                                   |  120%               |  We added nearly 240 new leads in Q4 alone, but that only accounts for about 66% of the target         |
|  Increase monthly revenue from $2.2M to $3.0M USD                                                                          |     15%            |  10 new accounts live in Q4 but traffic still not reflected in this month’s volumes         |
|   Achieve 7% avg gross margin                                                                         |    77%             |     Currently @ 5.4%      |
|                                                                            |                 |           |

2022 - Next Steps
=================

  

The role for the teams comprising the commercial areas of the company are straight forward. We grew Reloadly’s MRR 2X from 2020 to 2021, we now need to focus on growing 3X from 2021 to 2022. To reach that objective, we need to implement various changes and improvements that can impact our sales performance worldwide. These action items and initiatives can be divided into three categories:

  

1.  **Business Development** - These are initiatives and improvements that will help increase the number of prospects with whom we engage and that will make that engagement more likely to result in them wanting to integrate with Reloadly as their preferred supplier of digital products.
    
2.  **Integration** - Once we’ve successfully convinced a prospect of the value in working together, we need to get them live and selling as quickly as possible. This, more than anything else, will be the number one focus for the commercial teams in Q1 2022. 
    
3.  **Account Management** - Once each new account is live we need to help them reach their sales potential and ensure we remain engaged and relevant to retain, grow and monetize each relationship.
    

  

The one area that impacts both Business Development and Account Management is hiring. Hiring for key outstanding roles will begin in Q1 and be an ongoing effort for the next few months. Our goal will be to have all commercial roles filled by the end of Q2 2022.
